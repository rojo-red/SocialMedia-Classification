# Social Media-Classification


Project Objective: The primary goal of this project is to develop a classification model that categorizes video comments into either 'opinions' or 'claims.'

Data Information: The dataset comprises approximately 20,000 rows and 12 columns (variables). This dataset was sourced from Coursera.

The project is divided into the following steps:
1 - Data Import and exploration 
2 - Data Manipulation and Trasformations 
3 - Data Splits for Modeling and Testing 
4 - Models Explorations
5 - Model Evaluation and Selection 
6 - Conclusions
